# 21.02 Nix

> _my code is possible if people want it :) the real value of NixOS is hardware and OS config can be turned into libraries! ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28900008))_

[The nix](https://nixos.org/) is [a package management system](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf) that enforces isolation and can work as a secondary package manager for any Linux without any risk.

It enforces [everything is text](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_modules), allowing easy switching of configurations with zero-efforts and zero-misconfigurations, formally defined as [reproducibility](https://www.thecodedmessage.com/posts/reproducibility/).

With nix its impossible to have partially installed applications ([closure](https://medium.com/scientific-breakthrough-of-the-afternoon/closure-vs-derivation-in-the-nix-package-manager-ec0eccc53407)). It makes [development environment too easy](https://yuanwang.ca/posts/getting-started-with-flakes.html), cross-compilation is as easy as choosing an attribute to build.


## Basic terminology

The term 'nix' can refer to multiple things and documentation around is very _chaotic_, that's why basic terminology is essential:

* Nix in general refers to [a purely functional package manager](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/introduction.html), that came in 2003 along with the [PhD Thesis by Eelco Dolstra](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf).

* [Nix langauge](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overview_of_the_Nix_Language) is a DSL for writing system or home configuration, used directly by nix package manager.

* [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is an OS built around nix as its only package manager which came later in 2007, nix _can be used outside NixOS_, and that's how I use it.

* [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) ([search](https://search.nixos.org/)) is world's largest and freshest package repository known till date with over 80k packages.

* https://cache.nixos.org is pre-built binary cache on top of nixpkgs, which stores all the versions of all the packages known till date, [425TiB in total as of May 2023](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-foundations-financial-summary-a-transparent-look-into-2022/28107/16).

* [Flakes](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixos-with-flakes/introduction-to-flakes) is an experimental feature of nix. This enables version pinning and making modules completely pure.


## Important projects / features

### 1. Home Manager

[nix-community/home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) is a part of nix-community github org that provides various "Nix Modules" for installing & configuring user-level programs.

[Nix Module System](/blogs/chasing-productivity-1.html#the-nix-s-module-system) is really interesting, [NixCon 2023 - Why choose Nix for configuration?](https://github.com/ryantm/evalModules) dives deep into it.


### 2. Comma

[nix-community/comma](https://github.com/nix-community/comma) allows running binaries transiently/ephemerally, What if I don't have neofetch?

```bash
$ , neofetch
```

And that's it, I don't need to search the package that provides that binary, nor I have to install it, just run it!

### 3. DevShells

The [numtide/devshell](https://github.com/numtide/devshell/) helps one to quickly bootstrap a project's build environment just by running `nix develop`.

The [devshell docs](https://numtide.github.io/devshell/intro.html) are really good, as well as [this article](https://yuanwang.ca/posts/getting-started-with-flakes.html).

Their statement is

> It should not take more than 10 minutes from the time you clone a repo and can start contributing.

It prepares the shell with all the build dependencies, the environmental variables, the services (e.g. development database), and provides a handy menu for common commands for the newcomers to the project.

### 4. SnowfallLib

This [snowfallorg/lib](https://github.com/snowfallorg/lib) is a support library for giving a file structure to system/home configuration based flakes (NixOS, home-manager, and nix-darwin).

I personally prefer it to elliminate boilerplate in `flake.nix` at root of project.

## Notes

### 1. Config Dump

```bash
nix show-config  # Shows dump of $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nix/nix.conf
```


### 2. [HM] Cleanup older generations

```bash
pushd ~/.local/state/nix/profiles && ls | awk "!/$(readlink home-manager)/ && /home-manager-/" | xargs rm && popd
nix-collect-garbage --delete-old
nix store gc --debug
```

Sometimes if a file is opened in any process it refuses to clean it up, rebooting and cleaning again may help.


### 3. Cross Compilation

Cross compilation is as easy as to expose package in a flake output or apply an overlay on nixpkgs and then choose flake path to build.

```bash
# Custom Flake
nix build '.#packages.x86_64-linux.pkgsCross.mingwW64.my_pkg'

# Pkg from nixpkgs, or your package overlayed on nixpkgs
nix build 'nixpkgs#pkgsCross.mingwW64.my_pkg'
```

[TODO] Expand on this into an article as this is not very well shown in any article AFAIK.

### 4. Ephemeral shell-scoped install

Examples:

```bash
nix-shell -p hello
nix shell nixpkgs#hello

nix-shell -p 'python3.withPackages(pp: [ packages.numpy ])' --pure
nix develop --impure --expr 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; mkShell { buildInputs = [ python3.withPackages(pp: [ packages.numpy ]) ]; }'
```

Misc info:

1. `nix-shell -p` and `nix shell` are alike.
2. `nix-shell` and `nix develop` are alike, with no argument former works with `shell.nix` latter works with `outputs.devShells.default` definition in `flake.nix`.
3. The `nix-shell` invokes stdenv, whereas `nix shell` doesn't.

### 5. Pining flake inputs

Its good to have consistent system with _single nixpkgs pin_ across all the commands, and to _not garbage-collect_ any of the flake inputs, atleast until the profile is activated.

```nix
{ inputs, ... }: {
  nix.registry.nixpkgs.flake = inputs.nixpkgs;                  # pin for new command syntax
  home.sessionVariables.NIX_PATH = "nixpkgs=${inputs.nixpkgs}"; # pin for old-command syntax

  # prevent 'all' the flake inputs from being garbage-collected until this profile is activated
  xdg.configFile."nix-flake-inputs".text = lib.concatStringsSep "\n" (map (ip: ip.outPath) (lib.attrValues inputs));
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cleaning up

Refer [nix#6141](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/6141), if even after rebooting and garbage collection paths aren't removed.

The steps for force removal, in case a path is blocked by a (unlikely to be happen) bug.

```bash
nix-store --query --referrers $path | xargs nix-store --delete
nix-store --query --referrers-closure $path | xargs nix-store --delete
sudo nix store delete $path --ignore-liveness
```
