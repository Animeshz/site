# 21.02 Nix

[Nix](https://nixos.org) can produce highly reproducible environment, that means you can replicate [my setup](https://github.com/Animeshz/linux-desktop) in your system without fighting for errors ever again.

Term nix can refer to [declarative nix language](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/nix) or [imperative nix package manager](https://github.com/NixOS/nix).

TODO.
