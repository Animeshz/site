# 21.02 Nix

[Nix](https://nixos.org) can produce highly reproducible environment, that means you can replicate [my setup](https://github.com/Animeshz/linux-desktop) in your system without fighting for errors ever again.

Term nix can refer to [declarative nix language](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/nix) or [imperative nix package manager](https://github.com/NixOS/nix).

TODO.

INCOMPLETE. JUST MAKING NOTES FOR MY OWN FOR THINGS I DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER FOR NOW.

## Useful Commands

```bash
nix show-config  # Shows dump of $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nix/nix.conf
```

## Really really remove something from system

Nix is sometimes too troublesome to deal with increasing space usage, due to the design philosophy.

To remove something for sure, as described in [nix#6141](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/6141),

Remove frm cfg & switch generation, then

* delete all generations manually using bash making sure current gen doesn't delete
  ```bash
  cd ~/.local/share/nix/profiles
  rm home-manager-* # <TAB> <C-DELETE-last-entry>
  ```
* garbage collect
  ```bash
  nix-collect-garbage -d
  ```
* delete referrer
  ```bash
  nix-store --query --referrers /nix/store/21n7lgbhyahwg4agxgwnf0h9i4b4xvxl-ruby3.1.4-puppet-7.26.0 | xargs nix-store --delete
  ```
* delete referrer closures
  ```bash
  nix-store --query  --referrers-closure /nix/store/2ka0zrmv9gl194f286r4k0jb6m5pc78v-ruby3.1.4-semantic_puppet-1.1.0/ | xargs nix-store --delete
  ```
* delete ignoring liveness
  ```bash
  sudo nix store delete /nix/store/2ka0zrmv9gl194f286r4k0jb6m5pc78v-ruby3.1.4-semantic_puppet-1.1.0/ --ignore-liveness --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'
  ```
* If yet still not removable, reboot and try all steps again, sometimes if something is loaded in memory (/proc/mmap) nix thinks it shouldn't be removed no matter what.
