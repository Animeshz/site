# 21.03 Cli Utilities

[kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty), [fish](https://fishshell.com) and [starship](https://starship.rs) are my default terminal, shell and prompt respectively. [Gogh](https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh) is really helpful for choosing a colorscheme.

My daily workflow is incomplete without [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), [7z](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) and [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger).

Monitoring tools like [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop), [dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust), [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei) and [bandwhich](https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich) comes in handy at just in time situations.

New rust projects like [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh) and [kalker](https://github.com/PaddiM8/kalker) boost productivity in general-purpose tasks.

## Keybinds

### Terminal

```lua
Ctrl+l          clear
Alt+l           ls
Alt+s           toggles `sudo`
{Ctrl+w,Alt+d}  {backspace,delete} whole word
Ctrl+{u,y}      copy/paste currently written
Alt+e           edit currently written ($EDITOR)

Ctrl+Shift+h    make terminal open as less (only kitty)
```

### (N)Vim

```lua
Abbreviation: <C> === Ctrl  <A> === Alt  <S> === Shift
Notation: ^T === <C-t> === Ctrl-t

/<regex>                 Search the opened file/buffer with regex pattern
:%s/<regex>/<replace>/g  Global replace (use \1 \2 ... to backreference groups), removing g replaces first occurrence on each line only
:%v/<regex>/d            %v is inverted search, /d will delete lines not matching the regex
                         (these two can also be paired with visual selection, only difference is that it doesn\'t require % after :)
:5                Goto 5th line
5|                Goto 5th character on current line
<<|>>|==          Tab in normal mode (== is smart add/reducer)
gg=G              Reindent whole file (gg & =G), similarly ggyG to yank file
"                 Access any register (+ being system clipboard); "+p and "+y being paste and copy respectively
viw | diw | yiw   Visual/Delete/Yank inside (a) word
v|V|<C-v>         Visual / LineVisual / VisualBlock mode
%                 Jump to parenthesis opening/closing
<C-o>|<C-S-i>     Next/Prev location of jump, in find (/)
<C-d>|<C-u>       Next/Prev function (not that important)
```

I stopped using f/F/t/T now, after [hop.nvim](https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim) or [hop.el](https://github.com/Animeshz/hop.el).

### Ranger

Majority of navigation, search, copy-paste keybinds are same as Vim's. Rest of are listed below.

```lua
F7              New Folder
:e <file>       New file (open text editor)
a|A             Append to name|extension
r               Open with
S               Open shell here
C-n|TAB|S-TAB   Create / Navigate between tabs
S-v             Select file(s)

?               Help
R               Force reload
```
