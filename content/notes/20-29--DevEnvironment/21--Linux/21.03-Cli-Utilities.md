# 21.03 Cli Utilities

[kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty), [fish](https://fishshell.com) and [starship](https://starship.rs) are my default terminal, shell and prompt respectively.

My daily workflow is incomplete without [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and [7z](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).

Monitoring tools like [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop), [dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust), [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei) and [bandwhich](https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich) comes in handy at just in time situations.

New rust projects like [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh) and [kalker](https://github.com/PaddiM8/kalker) boost productivity in general-purpose tasks.
