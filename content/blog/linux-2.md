"Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, is an expert of understatement in his leadership of Linux development community. When eager programmers would ask him, 'What part of Linux should I work on?' his answer would usually be, 'Let me know when you find out'."

<!-- Ref part 1 -->

<!-- Linux is a kernel that is an abstraction layer over the hardware providing a common interface to the user-space applications. -->
<!-- A linux in itself is just a kernel *(knows how to use hardware, but doesn't know what to do)*. A linux distro is what makes linux an Operating System -->
<!--
Because it runs from high-end servers to desktops and all the way to embedded platforms like raspberry-pi, there are numerous install methods available listed on particular distro's docs/wiki.

Mainly you'll find these three options:

* **iso:** Go-to option for desktop-linux (allows you to test linux without installing, and assist you in the installing process).
* **tar:** For manually format disk drive, direct extract and finish install (scriptable, good for servers).
* **chroot:** Similar to tar method, but can use internet.
