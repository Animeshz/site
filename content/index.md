* Curated Data is Information.
* Curated Information is Knowledge.
* Curated Knowledge is Wisdom.

*Data is exploding in this Information Age.* Let's together curate all the useful knowledge, instead of keep archiving the data forever.

You don't make a great museum by putting all the art in the world into a single room. That's a warehouse. What makes a great museum great is the stuffs that's <i>not</i> on the walls. Someone says no. A curator is involved, making conscious decisions about what should stay and what should go. The best is a sub-sub-subset of all the possibilities.
