* Curated Data is Information.
* Curated Information is Knowledge.
* Curated Knowledge is Wisdom.

*Data is exploding in this Information Age.* Let's together curate all the useful knowledge, instead of keep archiving the data forever.

You don't make a great museum by putting all the art in the world into a single room. That's a warehouse. What makes a great museum great is the stuffs that's <i>not</i> on the walls. Someone says no. A curator is involved, making conscious decisions about what should stay and what should go. The best is a sub-sub-subset of all the possibilities.

## This Site

Most of my [Blogs](/blogs/index.md) are based on How Computer Works & otherwise Useful Tools/Tips.

I maintain [Curated Awesome List](/awesome/index.md) of my personally favourite stuffs.

And there are a few [Notes](/notes/index.md) for things I believe are hard to search for.

<!-- Rest of the site may document myself e.g. on [My Point of Interest](/point-of-interest/index.md) and [My Setup](/setup/index.md). -->
