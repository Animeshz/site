This was breaking since emacs unlike most well-behaved softwares has <em>itch</em> to diverge from unix-philosophy. It&#39;ll give you cli option to chdir emacs to certain directory at startup which is literally of no use, as you can just cd and exec emacs instead... But emacs will never report directory change as you change file, it never calls chdir, never give you option to even allow you doing that from any elisp function. Dude!!! Ok I shouldn&#39;t rant this much in this page.</p><p>I had to write a simple <a href="https://github.com/Animeshz/emacs-chdir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">emacs-package</a> to fix it by calling chdir whenever <code>(default-directory)</code> changes.</p><h2 id="opened-a-pr-on-nixos-nixpkgs-to-fix-ruby-packaging" tabindex="-1">Opened a PR on NixOS/nixpkgs to fix ruby packaging <a class="header-anchor" href="#opened-a-pr-on-nixos-nixpkgs-to-fix-ruby-packaging" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Opened a PR on NixOS/nixpkgs to fix ruby packaging&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I&#39;ve used puppet (through RAL) along with nix, and its not packaged there, for the most obvious reason its not needed in NixOS.
