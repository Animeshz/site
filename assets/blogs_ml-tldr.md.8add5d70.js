Which is why holding an asset is a must. According to Robert, an asset is like nurturing a tree from the time it was a seed taking alot of effort &amp; carefulness, and later it gives you shade and fruits overtime. He also refer to asset more simply as something that works 24x7 for you and puts money in your pocket overnight while you&#39;re sleeping.</p><p>Employing someone 24x7 is exploitation<sup>1</sup>, whereas for <strong>machines</strong> they&#39;re meant to be working, idling them still takes away energy, they don&#39;t need rest to heal themselves or refresh their energy reserviors after a long workout. So why not utilize machines, and make them work as asset for you while they&#39;re idling?</p><p><sub>1.
