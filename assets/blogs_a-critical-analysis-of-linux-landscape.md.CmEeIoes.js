Well, this one&#39;s debatable, the desktop space is now finely grained in such a way that mimics windows / macos behavior that people have forgotten all the benefits of linux.</p><p>Or let&#39;s try again, how much of you know how to create a custom iso, even of a distro, with just one extra package in it. More often than not, not more than a few countable people may know that.

The problem is so frustrating that it deserves a whole article.</p><p>Back in the late &#39;90s, linux was simple and configurable to exactly how one wanted it to be. It was really a collection of simple modular components that could be plugged together at will to do real work. Adhering to a deeply considered philosophy of the user being in the drivers seat, without layers and layers of frameworks wrapping their tendrils into all manor of stuff they should not be touching.</p><p>Its been over 8 years of me using linux, and things have somehow gone way too far.</p><p>We&#39;re so ingrained in the tooling that we&#39;re not even able to do such a basic task ourselves. Even setting up a printer to do its job or setting a projector takes away hours of struggle, and whatever works - works by a very thin layer of workaround that may break any second.

Its a mess because of insane amounts of legacy.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the reason we have <code>/bin</code> and <code>/usr/bin</code> is not because they actually have some logical reason to be split like people coming up with reverse history about Unix System Resources will tell you. Its because one of the guys working on unix ran out of hard drive space to put their binaries so they got a new drive and needed a new folder for it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Things like hidden folders for config in your home directory were enabled by accident. Again, people working on unix wanted to hide . and .. from the ls output since its useless. And being gigabrain programmers, they just decided to check for . at the start of the name since that covers both. Then apps took advantage of this to create .hidden folders.</p></blockquote><p>Gobo Linux, NixOS/GuixSD, Bedrock Linux, and <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2019-08-17-introducing-distri/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Distri</a> does try to get away from <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/lsb.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LSB</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FHS</a>, and some also provide a symlink-layer for backward complatibility.</p><p>But it is still a big problem as they don&#39;t see much adoption.
