  Summary: small poll for my new operating system

  Hello everybody out there using minix -

  I&#39;m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won&#39;t be big and
  professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.  This has been brewing
  since april, and is starting to get ready.  I&#39;d like any feedback on
  things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat
  (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)
  among other things).

  I&#39;ve currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.
  This implies that I&#39;ll get something practical within a few months, and
  I&#39;d like to know what features most people would want.  Any suggestions
  are welcome, but I won&#39;t promise I&#39;ll implement them :-)

                Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)

  PS.  Yes - it&#39;s free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.
  It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never
  will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that&#39;s all I have :-(.
